# EasyNote

A javascript project to test some language features an development tools.
Easy note lets you write, edit and delete some temporary notes in localStorage. Notes, can be scribles, fast notes, when paper is not available :)

## Notes about the project
I tried to use jest wihout babel to import/export functions inside my tests using an experimental feature in
this open [issue](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/9430) indicating basic steps to make it work. In the end I didn't follow that path because it had little support, but leaving it here to test in the future.
